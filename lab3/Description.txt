# Parallelising tactic
We use a worker pool and try to distribute the work out on it as effitiently as possible. 

We have implemented the first version parallelising the seperate puzzlesolves. That unfortunately did not give us a good improvement, since we use the bm function to run each each puzzle 100 times to get an average speed of the puzzle solving. That makes the slowest puzzle a bottleneck and we therefore only get a speedup of XXXXX.

We have also implemented a parallel version of the refinement, but this has an error we haven't been able to solve.
