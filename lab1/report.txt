Assignment 1
---------------
We only parallelised the map function in jackknife. We could have parallelised resamples as well to get even further performance.


Assignment 2
---------------
We solved this assignment using the Par Monad and Strategies.
We had a lot of trouble with this assignment.
First of all we mistakenly did included the print of the solution when we looked at the Threadscope view. 
This made us very confused over why it took so much time and why it stopped execution in the middle. 
Furthermore the amount of GC made it hard for us to realize from the picture what was going on and we instead thought we had done something completly wrong. 
What made this extra hard for us to realize was also that the code for some reason didn't execute in parallel at all on one of our computers. 
It wasn't until we got help from a TA that we realized what was happening.
